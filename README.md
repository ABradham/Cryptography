Hi everyone,

Thanks for the warm welcome! I hope you enjoyed guessing the lie from my previous email. The lie was that I'm nationally ranked in Rock, Paper, Scissors. However, I am a big fan of the game and find it to be a great way to resolve a quick conflict.

Now, let's get to the truth! Two interesting facts about me are:

In 2017, I had the incredible opportunity to be part of an archaeological program where I helped excavate a Roman Domus. It was a fascinating experience that allowed me to explore history firsthand.

Another exciting experience was being able to send my name to Mars through the "Send Your Name to Mars" program by NASA. My name is now on board the Perseverance rover, venturing into the unknown depths of the red planet.

I'm really looking forward to getting to know all of you and working together this summer.
