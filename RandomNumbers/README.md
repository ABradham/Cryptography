# Random Numbers
The code in readBits.c implements the `Poker` probabalistic random number test as described by the [FIPS standard](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/140/1/archive/1994-01-11/documents/fips1401.pdf). 

## To Run
Simply type `make` while in this directory (`RandomNumbers/`). Doing so will save a list of predictions of the bitstreams in `list.txt` to a new file `output.txt`.
